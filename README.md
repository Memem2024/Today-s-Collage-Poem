# 🧩 Collage Poetry Generator

A small web prototype exploring **constraint-driven text recomposition**.

The tool breaks input text into reusable fragments and generates structured
4-line and 8-line collage poems under strict formal constraints.
Users can also manually recombine fragments to create new outputs.

The project focuses on **system design, constraints, and interaction** rather than end-to-end text generation.

**Tech**: TypeScript,  Vite,  client-side rendering  
**Scope**:  Creative technology / interaction-driven system  
**Status**:  Portfolio prototype
